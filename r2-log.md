## Log

<!-- 
### R2D1 
Started a Weather App. Worked on the draft layout of the app, struggled with OpenWeather API http://www.example.com

### R2D2
-->
### R2D10
Decided to try my hand at the reviled spiral chart from this [New York Times Opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/opinion/omicron-covid-us.html).

[![Worst or best data visualization? You decide](/Users/christineamuzie/Documents/GitHub/100-days-of-code/img/spiral-graph.png "Spiral Graph of COVID-19 Cases, United States")](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/06/opinion/omicron-covid-us.html)

I'm hoping I did it justice in R. Special thanks to [Zuguang Gu](https://github.com/jokergoo) for the spiralize package that made this possible.
